> \* _The `vX.<EVEN_NUMBER>.X` and `vX.<ODD_NUMBER>.X-pre` convetion is following the [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions):_  
> _That is, if 1.2.3 is uploaded as a pre-release, the next regular release must be uploaded with a distinct version, such as 1.2.4. Full semver support will be available in the future.  
> ... So, we recommend that extensions use `major.EVEN_NUMBER.patch` for release versions and `major.ODD_NUMBER.patch` for pre-release versions. For example: `0.2.*` for release and `0.3.*` for pre-release._
